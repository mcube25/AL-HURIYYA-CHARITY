<div class="col-md-8" id='message'>
<p>On the authority of Ibn umar who said :A man came to the prophet (S A W) and said : O messanger of Allah which of the people are most beloved to Allah and which of the actions are most beloved by Allah?
 The messanger (S A W) said: THe most beloved of the people of Allah are the most beneficient for the people,most beloved of actions to Allah are to cause happiness to reach a muslim, to relieve a muslim from hardship, to settle a debt for a muslim or to repel hunger from him. For me to walk with a brother in order to assist him is more beloved to me than to make 'itikaf in this masjid (masjid al-madinah) for a month....Whoever walks with his brother in order to assist him with a need until he has helped him completely, then Allah plants his feet firmly on the day the people will not stand firmly. Indeed bad behaviour spoils a good action just as vinegar spoils honey.</p>

<div id='executive' class='executive council'>
<h3 class='state'>Executive Board</h3>
<p class='answer'><strong>Al-Hurriyah is a project manned by Muslim women who are passionate about Islam, children and individual/collective rights.  Over the years, they have seen and felt, cried and smiled, trusted and shared; it’s a jungle out there.
There are so many ills in the society, too much injustice and it is saddening. Individually, each feels that much can’t be achieved in doing ones singular part for the society, so they decided it was time a body was set up for that purpose.
However, they don’t want to do this alone, for the only reward is the Pleasure of Allaah (SWT). That is why they are sharing this venture with the public; especially those people who want to assist those in need and don't have the 'big bucks' to do so. They also feel that women and children are usually at the receiving end when any disaster happens...directly or indirectly.
This is the drive…and all hope…all reward is with Allaah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala), in shaa’ Allaah.</strong></p>

<h3 class="state"><img src="https:/">Daughters, wives and Mothers</h3>
<p class='answer'>It is a tough world and everyone can do with help and useful assistance. It’s with this in mind that three sisters came together as far back as 2005 to start a project that will target the young teenage girl as she grows up, develops to a young adult and eventually a full grown woman.</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>DWM was started off with our focus on the Muslim woman. However, it was soon realized that Muslim teenagers (fondly referred to as MTEENs) cannot be separated in their need for nurturing and mentoring. Thus DWM – at least the Daughters arm - decided to focus on the MTEENs first.</li>
  <li>DWM is currently based in Lagos, Nigeria and will partner with other reputable organizations – Nigerian or beyond - to provide a strong base to mentor, nurture and guide Muslim teens through the murky waters of early adolescence and hope , to steer them onto the straight path in service to , themselves, the ummah and Islam.</li>
  <li>DWM will grow, , from the initial step of guiding and mentoring young adults, to supporting young wives and ultimately learning with mothers till we provide total package that presents to all, the great gift of Islam. We hope to help in regaining and retaining the pure teachings of Islam, , for ourselves, our families and our ummah.

<h5 class="state">Be Unique</h5>
<p class="answer">There is comfort in conformity, lying low and blending with the crowd. As a result, many a times, we let our world such as friends, family, television, workplaces, and all these other things define us. We keep borrowing appearances and catch whatever appears to be ‘the thing' of the season and run with it. This pretense does not get us anywhere. In fact it adds to stress as we become preoccupied with keeping up appearances and are saddled with the prospect of never living up to our potentials.</p>
<p class="answer">Each and every person has a being created differently to fulfill a different role and purpose: Did you think that we had created you in play (without any purpose)… (Q23:115). What is your purpose? How do you find your uniqueness?</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Understand who you are</li>
</ul>
<p class="answer">We tend to underestimate the importance of knowing ourselves. Many of us go through each day reacting to events and just getting by rather than making conscious choices based on who we are and what we want. We are too busy with everything else that in the end, suffocates the person inside. Self knowledge is the pillar of all values; without it, nothing else is genuine.</p>
<p class="answer"><strong>Is he who walks on his face (without seeing) more rightly guided, or he who (sees and) walks upright on the straight path? (Q67: 22)</strong></p>
<p class="answer">To know yourself</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Be aware of your strengths, weaknesses, values, likes and dislikes</li>
<li>Observe and be aware of your moods, reactions and responses to what is happening around you</li>
<li>Become aware of how these moods and emotions affect your state of mind</li>
<li>Examine how you interact with others</li>
<li>Observe how your environment affects you</li>
<p class="answer">Knowing and understanding yourself leads to better decision making, setting and reaching appropriate goals and altogether living more productively.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Trust your intuition and instincts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="answer">Part of knowing who you are and expressing your uniqueness is trusting your intuition and instincts. We all have an inner gauge that guides us along our most fulfilling path. Look deep within to find the answers to your life. No one is better at knowing what you need and want from life than you. Of course, it is prudent to listen to the advice of family, friends and professionals, but you are the ultimate authority on you. You are unique and original and no one but you can make your decisions for you.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Express yourself by cultivating your own style, tastes and personality.</li>
</ul>
<p class='answer'>There is absolutely no need to follow the crowd. Make your life an expression of who you are. Have the courage to follow your heart. This makes you more genuine, authentic, interesting and attractive to others. Let go of fear and embrace your uniqueness. If you desire to be an Event Manager, don't settle for being an accountant because someone wants you to be, or because you can make more money at it. In the end you will lose out because the money won't matter if you're unhappy, unmotivated or depressed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Believe in yourself and don't worry about what others think.</li>
</ul>
<p class="answer">When you choose the right path for yourself, do not allow the opinions of others to distract you. People are good at offering well-intentioned, unsolicited opinions. However only you know what's best for you. Don't let a lack of self-confidence or self-doubt prevent you from pursuing what you know is best for you. Let go of your personal insecurities. If you strive to be someone you're not, you will never be happy. Be yourself and be proud of who you are. People who have a more positive view of themselves live better, healthier lives.</p>
<p class="answer">Take time with you and define yourself. Don’t wait for the world to define you. Dare to be unique, dare to be courageous, dare to be strong and vibrant, dare to be who you are, and be it the best way you know how and in shaa Allaah, you will be on the path to realize the full potential of your unique skills and talents and enjoying the fullness of life.</p>
